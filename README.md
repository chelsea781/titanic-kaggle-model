# Hello!! 
# I am Chelsea! I tackled the Titanic Kaggle Challenge.

# This is my first time ever challenging Machine Learning!!

# In this project, I attempt to build a model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features. This project is part of the Kaggle Titanic competition.

## Overview

# The dataset consists of information about passengers, such as:
#- Age
#- Class
#- Gender
#- Family size
#- Ticket price

# I used RandomForestClassifier models and cross-validation to improve the prediction accuracy!!

### My journey:
- This was my first Kaggle competition.
- Learned a lot about data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- Worked with different machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
  
Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
